# Customer-Churn-Prediction-Machine-Learning-Project
📊 Customer Churn Prediction – Analytics & Machine Learning Project
📌 Project Overview

Customer churn is a critical business challenge in the telecom industry. This project focuses on analyzing customer data to identify key factors influencing churn and building a machine learning–based solution to support data-driven decision making.

The objective is to demonstrate an end-to-end analytics workflow—from data exploration and insight generation to model development and deployment—while maintaining a strong focus on business relevance and interpretability.

🎯 Objectives

Analyze customer behavior to understand why customers churn

Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover trends and patterns

Build classification models to predict churn

Translate analytical results into clear, actionable insights

Demonstrate how analytics and ML can support operational intelligence

Deploy the solution for interactive prediction
